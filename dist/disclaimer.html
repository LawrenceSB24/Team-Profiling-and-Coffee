<!-- DISCLAIMER -->

<!-- So while adding comments to each piece of the application, I had realized -->
<!-- that the video I had given for functionality of the mailto -->
<!-- for populating the TO field with the email address of the team member -->
<!-- was not shown due to selecting a mail application where I didnot posess -->
<!-- my login information. The mailto should work as intended without any errors -->

<!-- Observations -->

<!-- So There are two references of information for the creation of the Team -->
<!-- Profiler application that I reffered to for the creation of my team profiler -->
<!-- using Express.js. I case you are having further isssues with the functionality -->
<!-- of your team profiler, then I highly suggest these two links below. -->
